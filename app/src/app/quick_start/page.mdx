# Quick environment setup

Spark is designed to scale with the amount of compute you have available, so typically people develop it in a cloud environment (e.g. Databricks, Dataproc, Codelab, EMR, Synapse).{{ className: 'lead' }}


If you have access to a Spark cloud environment, then feel free to follow along in a notebook there. If not, then **we can use Docker to spin up a local Spark environment in a few minutes.** {{ className: 'lead' }}

One last thing, for these examples, **we're going to focus on PySpark** (the Python API for Spark). {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Download Docker
Download and install docker [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Create a file called `docker-compose.yaml` in your root directory

This file will setup a Spark-enabled Jupyter environment. It will also mount local `./data` and `./notebooks` folders to the container so you can access them from inside the Docker container. If the folders do not exist already they will be created automatically.

We won't go into the full
details of Docker Compose here, but you can read more about it [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```dockerfile {{ title: 'docker-compose.yaml' }}
version: '3.8'
services:
  jupyter:
    image: jupyter/pyspark-notebook:latest
    container_name: jupyter
    working_dir: /notebooks                 # Working directory inside container
    ports:
      - 8888:8888                           # map local port 8888 to container port 8888
    volumes:
      - ./data/:/data                       # mount local `./data` folder to `/data` inside container
      - ./notebooks/:/notebooks             # mount local `./notebooks` folder to `/notebooks` inside container
```

## Starting Docker

**To start your docker container** run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

One the container is up and running, you should see a link to access Jupyter in your browser. It will look something like this:

```bash
jupyter  | [I 2024-01-23 17:50:34.864 ServerApp] Jupyter Server 2.8.0 is running at:
jupyter  | [I 2024-01-23 17:50:34.864 ServerApp] http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=xxxxxxxxx
```

## Stopping Docker

**To stop your container** run the following:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
