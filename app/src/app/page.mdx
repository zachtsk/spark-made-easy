# âš¡ Spark Made Easy

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a simple, massively scalable, data processing engine. For most common data tasks, it is often simpler and more scalable than using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
And if you're already comfortable with SQL, you can learn about 80% of what you'll probably ever need in a single afternoon. {{ className: 'lead' }}

*Spark Made Easy* is an opinionated guide to help you learn the basics, along with teaching you common design patterns to help make your code simple, clean, and readable. {{className:"lead"}}
